## Architecture Overview

MinDB uses a layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Public API    │  <- S3-compatible public interface
├─────────────────┤
│  Storage Engine │  <- Core storage logic
├─────────────────┤
│  File System    │  <- File system abstraction
├─────────────────┤
│   Monitoring    │  <- Performance monitoring and health checks
└─────────────────┘
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Use buffer pools to reduce allocations
- **Concurrency**: Fine-grained locking to avoid contention
- **I/O Optimization**: Configurable buffer sizes and direct I/O
- **Caching**: Smart caching of hot data
- **Cleanup**: Background cleanup to avoid blocking operations

## Debugging Tips

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export MINDB_LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run specific tests
go test -run TestSpecificFunction -v

# Performance profiling
go test -bench=BenchmarkFunction -cpuprofile=cpu.prof
go tool pprof cpu.prof

# Memory profiling
go test -bench=BenchmarkFunction -memprofile=mem.prof
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

## Release Process

### Version Release

1. **Prepare Release**
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update version numbers
   - Run complete test suite

2. **Create Release**
   - Create git tag
   - Push to GitHub
   - Create GitHub Release

3. **Post-Release**
   - Update documentation
   - Notify community
   - Monitor feedback

### Versioning Strategy

- **Major Version**: Breaking changes
- **Minor Version**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch Version**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Getting Help

If you need help during testing or development:

- 📖 Check the [Testing Documentation](docs/testing.md)
- 💬 Ask questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/elastic-io/mindb/discussions)
- 🐛 Create an [Issue](https://github.com/elastic-io/mindb/issues) to report problems
- 📧 Contact maintainers for assistance

## Community Guidelines

### Communication

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Use clear, concise language in issues and PRs
- Provide context and examples when asking for help
- Search existing issues before creating new ones

### Collaboration

- Review other contributors' PRs when possible
- Share knowledge and help newcomers
- Participate in discussions and provide feedback
- Respect different opinions and approaches

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. Email the maintainers directly at security@elastic-io.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices

When contributing code:

- Validate all inputs
- Use secure coding practices
- Avoid hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Consider security implications of changes

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Use clear, concise comments
- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Include usage examples where helpful
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### README and Guides

- Use clear headings and structure
- Include practical examples
- Test all code examples
- Keep language simple and accessible

## Performance Guidelines

### Writing Efficient Code

- Profile before optimizing
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize memory allocations
- Consider concurrent access patterns
- Benchmark performance-critical paths

### Memory Management

- Use buffer pools for frequent allocations
- Avoid memory leaks in long-running operations
- Consider garbage collection impact
- Monitor memory usage in tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Clean and retry
   make clean
   make test-smoke
   
   # Check for race conditions
   make test-verbose
   ```

2. **Performance Regressions**
   ```bash
   # Compare with baseline
   make benchmark
   
   # Profile specific operations
   make cpu-profile
   make memory-profile
   ```

3. **Build Issues**
   ```bash
   # Update dependencies
   go mod tidy
   go mod download
   
   # Check Go version
   go version  # Should be 1.21+
   ```

### Getting Unstuck

If you're stuck on an issue:

1. Check the documentation and examples
2. Search existing issues and discussions
3. Create a detailed issue with:
   - What you're trying to do
   - What you've tried
   - Error messages or unexpected behavior
   - Your environment details
